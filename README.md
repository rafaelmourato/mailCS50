#Mail

## Intro

This is the Project 3 from **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**.  
Instructors: Brian Yu and David J. Malan

### Summary

The goal of this activity is to recreate an mail softwre, applying the knowledge acquired from the classes on HTML, CSS styling, Django and JavaScript.

### Specifications

#### Send Mail
- [x]  When a user submits the email composition form, add JavaScript code to actually send the email.
- [x] Once the email has been sent, load the user‚Äôs sent mailbox.
#### Mailbox
- [x] When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, load the appropriate mailbox.
- [x] When a mailbox is visited, the application should first query the API for the latest emails in that mailbox.
- [x] Each email should then be rendered in its own box (e.g. as a <div> with a border) that displays who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the timestamp of the email.
- [x] If the email is unread, it should appear with a white background. If the email has been read, it should appear with a gray background.
#### View Email
- [x] Your application should show the email‚Äôs sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and body. 
- [x] You‚Äôll likely want to make a GET request to /emails/<email_id> to request the email.
- [x] When a user clicks on an email, the user should be taken to a view where they see the content of that email.
- [x] You‚Äôll likely want to add an additional div to inbox.html (in addition to emails-view and compose-view) for displaying the email. Be sure to update your code to hide and show the right views when navigation options are clicked.
- [x] Once the email has been clicked on, you should mark the email as read. Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to update whether an email is read or not.
#### Archive and Unarchive
- [x] Allow users to archive and unarchive emails that they have received. 
- [x] When viewing an Inbox email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them archive the email. When viewing an Archive email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them unarchive the email.
- [x] Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/<email_id> to mark an email as archived or unarchived.
- [x] Once an email has been archived or unarchived, load the user‚Äôs inbox.
#### Reply
- [x] Allow users to reply to an email.
- [x] When viewing an email, the user should be presented with a ‚ÄúReply‚Äù button that lets them reply to the email.
- [x] When the user clicks the ‚ÄúReply‚Äù button, they should be taken to the email composition form. 
- [x] Pre-fill the composition form with the recipient field set to whoever sent the original email.
- [x] Pre-fill the subject line. If the original email had a subject line of foo, the new subject line should be Re: foo. (If the subject line already begins with Re: , no need to add it again.)
- [x] Pre-fill the body of the email with a line like "On Jan 1 2020, 12:00 AM foo@example.com wrote:" followed by the original text of the email.
